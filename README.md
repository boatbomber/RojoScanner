# Rojo Scanner

It scans the addresses you give to find your served projects and lets you select and connect to one. You can choose to be notified about found projects if you aren't yet connected. As you can see, it uses the headless API and is therefore linked to the state of the Rojo plugin, so connecting/disconnecting from either will inform the other. This makes life easier for people who use multiple ports, or just want to see which project is being served before connecting.
